# Compatibility manifest

What runs in zx_go. This is a working document — every entry has a
status, the model it was tested on, and (if "Issue") a brief note.
The list isn't exhaustive; it's the titles a contributor has
specifically loaded and run to a point of confident "works" or
"broken here". To add an entry, follow the protocol at the bottom.

Status legend:
- **Works** — boots to title screen, accepts input, plays.
- **Works (caveat)** — playable but with a known emulator-side
  imperfection. Caveat documented in the Notes column.
- **Parses cleanly** — file-format parser accepts the image
  without error. No gameplay verification.
- **Known issue** — loads partway, crashes, or visibly wrong.
  Filed as a GitHub issue (linked).
- **Untested** — no contributor has run this through yet.

Confidence note: every title below sits on top of the same Z80 core
that passes both Cringle exerciser suites
([zexdoc and zexall](../pkg/z80/testdata/conformance/README.md)).
"Works" therefore means CPU correctness is not under suspicion when
something does go wrong — it's almost always a peripheral or timing
issue. See "Foundation tests" for what blanket-cover tests do and
don't buy you.

## Foundation tests

These integration tests under `pkg/testharness` (and one in
`pkg/plus3fdc`) prove the *foundation* for each category works.
They do **not** prove arbitrary programs in the category run
correctly — they prove the boot path and primary API surface are
sound, which narrows the debug area when a specific title misbehaves.

| Test | What it proves |
|---|---|
| `TestNewBoots48K` (testharness) | The 48K ROM boots and writes screen attribute state — any failure here would indicate a broken core, not a broken title. |
| `TestIF1CATCommand` (testharness) | Interface 1 + Microdrive paging, ROM hooks, and `CAT 1` execution work. Doesn't prove arbitrary IF1 software runs. |
| `TestDiscipleColdBootAndKeypress` (testharness) | DISCiPLE pages in, boots GDOS, and accepts keypresses. Doesn't prove arbitrary GDOS programs run. |
| `TestSaveDSKRoundTrip` (plus3fdc) | +3 disk image parser / writer is symmetric. Doesn't prove arbitrary +3 disk titles boot. |
| `TestNextRealROMBoot` (testharness) | NextZXOS boots through ~10K instructions without crashing. Doesn't prove it reaches the BASIC prompt or any specific Next title runs. |
| `TestModelNextLayer2VisibleEndToEnd` (testharness) | The NextReg → palette → Layer 2 → compositor pipeline produces correct RGBA pixels. Doesn't prove arbitrary Layer 2 demos look right (timing, sprite layering, Copper sync). |
| `TestLoadNEXAgainstRealSample` (testharness) | The .NEX V1.2 parser correctly reads banks 0–7 from a real distro file. Banks ≥8 are silently skipped — `.nex` files using extended banks won't load fully. |
| `TestZexdoc`, `TestZexall` (z80) | Every documented Z80 instruction passes Cringle's exerciser; every undocumented behaviour (F3/F5, MEMPTR/WZ partial, DDCB register-copy) passes too. |

If a title in a covered category fails, the bug is almost certainly
in a peripheral driver, timing, or untested undocumented behaviour —
not the core CPU.

## 48K titles

Canonical 48K titles. None have been individually verified through
zx_go yet; foundation tests confirm the 48K boot path works.

| Title | Status | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| Manic Miner | Untested | |
| Jet Set Willy | Untested | |
| Knight Lore | Untested | Filled 3D — exercises attribute clash handling |
| Atic Atac | Untested | |
| Sabre Wulf | Untested | |
| Skool Daze | Untested | |
| The Hobbit | Untested | |
| Lords of Midnight | Untested | |
| Elite (Spectrum port) | Untested | |
| Chuckie Egg | Untested | |
| Horace Goes Skiing | Untested | |
| Jet Pac (Interface 2 cartridge) | Untested | IF2 cartridge slot wired and tested in `if2_test.go` |
| Pssst (Interface 2 cartridge) | Untested | Same IF2 path as Jet Pac |

## 128K / +2 titles

Titles that use the AY-3-8912 sound chip and/or the extended 128K
memory map. Foundation tests confirm 128K paging works.

| Title | Status | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| Robocop (Ocean) | Untested | AY soundtrack |
| Renegade | Untested | |
| Target: Renegade | Untested | |
| R-Type (Spectrum port) | Untested | |
| Lemmings (Spectrum port) | Untested | |
| Where Time Stood Still | Untested | |
| Head over Heels | Untested | |
| Last Ninja 2 | Untested | |
| Match Day II | Untested | |
| The Way of the Tiger | Untested | |

## +3 / +2A disk titles

Titles distributed on +3 floppy disk. Foundation: `plus3fdc`
DSK / EDSK / UDI round-trip tests prove the disk container code is
symmetric, but no individual +3 title has been loaded and run.

| Title | Status | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| Cobra (Ocean, 1986) — +3 disk | Parses cleanly | 194816-byte CPCEMU DSK, 40 tracks, 1 side. Round-trips through `plus3fdc.ParseDiskImage` without errors. Not yet run to gameplay end-to-end. |
| Lemmings (+3 disk reissue) | Untested | |
| Where Time Stood Still (+3 disk reissue) | Untested | |
| Driller (+3 disk reissue) | Untested | |
| Total Eclipse (+3 disk reissue) | Untested | |

If you have a +3 DSK image that isn't listed and you want to add it,
follow the protocol at the bottom of this document.

## Demoscene

Demoscene productions exercise timing-sensitive features —
mid-frame border palette switches, AY register tricks, contention
patterns, multi-loader tape rituals — that the test harness doesn't
cover. Visual + audio inspection is the only verification.

A general note rather than specific titles: zx_go's mid-frame border
tracking (per-scanline, see `pkg/ula`) and AY-3-8912 register
semantics should handle typical demo techniques, but no specific
demo has been run through the full pipeline yet. Spectrum demos worth
trying as stress tests are anything that uses a multicolour technique
(8×1 attribute blocks via raster-synced palette writes), or anything
labelled "intro" or "megademo" from a known group (Triebkraft, Raww
Arse, Mayhem, Lyra) — these are the productions most likely to
expose timing imperfections.

## Spectrum Next titles

The Next cold-boots NextZXOS end-to-end — splash → firmware → welcome
→ menu/Browser/NextBASIC — see [docs/spectrum-next.md](spectrum-next.md).
The individual hardware blocks (Layer 2 incl. hi-res, the sprite
engine, tilemap, Copper, the NextReg file, the 8K MMU) are tested
against the FPGA VHDL.

**Running arbitrary `.NEX` games is the newest and least-finished
part of zx_go, and the most likely place to hit a bug.** `.nex`
titles are launched through NextZXOS's own loader, so OS-dependent
games run as on hardware — but per-title behaviour varies widely.

The table below is the July 2026 headless triage sweep: every title
was launched through the genuine `.nexload` path on the current SD
distro (`ZX_GO_RUN_NEX_FILE`, see the headless notes in
docs/architecture/frontends.md), run 12000–18000 frames with
screenshots and crash heuristics, and the failures were state-dumped
to a first observed divergence signature. "Works (title)" means the
title screen/menu renders and the game was not driven further
headless — not a full playability verdict.

| Title | Status | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| Sonic the Hedgehog | Works (caveat) | Renders level/scroll/sprite/HUD and is controllable (arrows + Right-Alt/Ctrl). Residual: a few HUD icons in the top-right diverge from hardware (a game-loop/interrupt-timing detail, not a render bug). Not re-run in the 2026-07 sweep (file not present). |
| Celeste | Works | Menu and in-game verified headless: ENTER starts the game, level + player render, gameplay frames advance. |
| Nextoid | Works (caveat) | Boots to its input menu; drivable ('S' then SPACE). Note for headless driving: the menu's key poll only starts a few hundred frames after the menu is visible (intro loops run first), so fixed-frame key schedules are easy to mistime. |
| Quantum Storm | Works (menu) | Options menu renders. Default controls are a pad ("8BitDo M30") — see the NR $B0-$B2 gap below; input not verified. |
| Head Over Heels (Next) | Works (title) | Title logo renders. |
| Lords of Midnight (Next) | Works (title) | Title screen renders. |
| Scramble (Next) | Works (title) | Title screen renders. |
| Space Invaders (Next) | Works (title) | Title screen renders. |
| Tyvarian | Works (title) | Title screen renders. |
| Warhawk | Known issue | Title + high-score screens render, but the game cannot be started: it polls input ~40k times via NextReg $B2 (extended keys / MD pad) and barely touches the $FE matrix — NR $B0/$B1/$B2 are unimplemented, so it never sees a keypress. |
| NextBASIC Invaders | Known issue | Draws the first invader wave, then freezes (screen hash identical for thousands of frames). Stuck spinning with IM 2 + interrupts disabled and SP=$20B6 while MMU slots 0/1 are ROM — pushed return addresses are discarded (the SP-in-ROM-window wreckage class below). Earlier report: `Integer out of range` during play — a NextBASIC `DEFPROC` parameter/local-var storage divergence ([janko-jj's reports](https://github.com/conorarmstrong/zx_go/issues)). |
| Baggers in Space (Stonechat Games) | Known issue | Black screen after load. Stuck in a 9-instruction infinite loop calling its MMU6/7 paging helper: SP=$2098 with MMU slots 0/1 = ROM, so CALL pushes vanish and RET pops constant ROM bytes (SP-in-ROM-window class). |
| Crowley World Tour | Known issue | Black screen after load. Spinning with IM 2 + interrupts disabled, SP=$20AE in the ROM window (SP-in-ROM-window class). |
| Bomb Jack (Next) | Known issue | Black screen, but the game is ALIVE: line interrupt (NR $22=$06/$23=$BE, frame INT disabled) fires once per frame, the main loop polls Kempston $1F. Layer 2 is enabled (bank via NR $12) yet its palette is never uploaded (default ramp) and no pixels appear — graphics-upload/display-path divergence, not a CPU hang. |
| Saboteur (Next) | Known issue | Black screen. Busy-spins (>1.3G instructions) with interrupts disabled in IM 0, polling NextReg read-back via port $253B; zero interrupts taken after launch. |
| Way of the Exploding Fist (Next) | Known issue | Black screen. Executes HALT with IFF1=0 in IM 2 shortly after launch — unrecoverable by design, so the divergence is upstream of the HALT. |
| TX-1696 | Known issue | Never leaves the OS: after `.nexload`, ends HALTed at a ROM idle loop in IM 1 with frame interrupts running — the launch fails back to NextZXOS (loader-path issue, distinct from the in-game classes). |
| RAMS | Known issue | First screen renders corrupt (one broken character block). The hardware build leans on cycle-exact tricks — its own distribution ships a separate emulator-specific `.nex` variant — so this title sits in the architectural-timing class (conformance Axis 10), not the quick-fix list. |
| Atic Atac (Next) | Untested | The local `ATICATAC.NEX` is 111 MB — not a valid `.nex`; needs a clean download before it can be triaged. |

### Next failure classes and the ranked gap list (2026-07 triage)

The failures cluster into classes; ranked by how many titles each
blocks (the conformance prioritizer — see work item #159):

1. **SP-in-ROM-window wreckage — 3 titles** (Baggers in Space,
   Crowley World Tour, NextBASIC Invaders). Shared signature: game
   hangs spinning with interrupts disabled and SP inside
   $2000-$3FFF while MMU slots 0/1 read $FF (ROM), so CALL/RET is
   broken. On hardware these games run, so the observed state is
   wreckage — the first divergence is upstream (candidates: divMMC
   automap in/out timing around the dot-command → game handoff,
   NR $50/$51 restore semantics, an interrupt racing the handoff).
   **The top lockstep-bisect candidate: one root cause likely
   unblocks all three.**
2. **DI busy-spin / dead-halt after launch — 3 titles** (Saboteur,
   Aliens Neoplasma spin with interrupts off; Way of the Exploding
   Fist HALTs with IFF1=0). Possibly the same upstream cause as
   class 1 (all die at/near the loader → game handoff), but the
   signatures differ (SP intact). Lockstep candidates.
3. **NR $B0/$B1/$B2 extended-keys / MD-pad registers unwired —
   blocks input in 1 title outright, risk for 2+** (Warhawk
   unstartable; Quantum Storm defaults to pad controls). Concrete,
   small, matrix-actionable: reflect the keyboard matrix + joystick
   state into NR $B0-$B2 read-back. Best value-for-effort row.
4. **Alive-but-black display path — 1 title** (Bomb Jack: line IRQ
   delivered, game loop runs, Layer 2 enabled, but its palette/pixel
   upload never lands). Suspects: DMA transfer path, Layer 2 write
   mapping via port $123B banking. Needs a reference diff to
   localize.
5. **`.nexload` launch falls back to OS — 1 title** (TX-1696).
   Loader/esxDOS-API path, distinct from the in-game classes.
6. **Architectural timing (Axis 10) — 1 title** (RAMS). Its authors
   ship a per-emulator build; do not chase before the contention /
   sub-line timing items land.

Classes 1 and 2 are why the reference-emulator lockstep harness
matters: the wreckage dumps show where each game DIED, not where it
DIVERGED. The `--next-bisect` / `--next-lockstep` / `--next-nrdiff` /
`--next-memdiff` drivers exist for exactly this walk-back; they
compile under the development-only `oracle` build tag with a local
reference-emulator driver.

If a Next game fails for you, **that is expected at this stage** —
please file it (with what you see vs. real hardware / a stable
emulator) so it can be fixed. The Next title scene is small enough
that any contributor running public `.nex` releases from specnext.com
or itch.io should add their own rows above as they verify them.
**No fabrications** — only list titles you've actually run, and
mark anything unverified as Untested.

## Tape format edge cases

The `pkg/ula` tape pipeline supports both TAP (load + save) and TZX
(load + save, blocks 0x10 / 0x11 / 0x14). Edge cases worth verifying
manually:

- **Speedlock / Alkatraz loaders**: turbo blocks with non-standard pilot
  lengths. Format support is present; correct decoding of every
  variant is not exhaustively tested.
- **Multi-side tapes**: side-A side-B "flip the tape" sequences in
  adventure games (Lords of Midnight Vol 1, etc.). Stop Tape from the
  menu and load the next side.
- **Multi-load games (lots of action games)**: ensure the fast tape
  trap doesn't interfere with multi-block loaders; turn it off if so.

## Joystick configurations

Verified by the keymap unit tests (`pkg/keyboard/keyboard_test.go`).
Picking the right joystick for a given game is essential:

- **Kempston** (port 0x1F) — most arcade games of the late 80s
- **Sinclair 1** (keys 1-5) — Sinclair Interface 2 left side; games
  with explicit "Sinclair joystick" support
- **Sinclair 2** (keys 6-0) — right side
- **Cursor / Protek** (keys 5/6/7/8/0) — fewer games; check title
  documentation

## How class evidence works

When a title isn't on the list, you can still predict whether it'll
run by figuring out which class it belongs to:

1. Is it pure 48K BASIC? → `TestNewBoots48K` covers it.
2. Does it use the AY sound chip? → Multi-AY tests cover register
   semantics; if your title uses AY through standard ports, the
   sound will play.
3. Does it use IF1 / Microdrive? → `TestIF1CATWorks` covers the boot
   path.
4. Does it use DISCiPLE / +D? → `TestDISCiPLEBootsIntoGDOS` covers
   the boot path.
5. Does it use +3 disks? → `TestPlus3FDCDiskRoundtrip` covers disk
   I/O.
6. Does it depend on cycle-exact contention (e.g. multicolour
   scanline tricks)? → Open in a hex editor, check whether it does
   raster waiting via T-state loops; if yes, expect potential
   wobble.
7. Is it a Next .NEX file? → Banks 0-7 fully supported; 8-111
   silently skipped today.

## How to add a title

When you load a title and want to record the result:

1. Try the title on the appropriate model (most 48K games stay on
   48K; +3 disk games need +3; etc.).
2. Note any peripheral state required (DISCiPLE on/off, joystick
   selection).
3. Run far enough to confirm the title is functional — not just
   "shows the loading screen" but "playable".
4. Add a row to the appropriate table:
   - **Works** for clean runs.
   - **Works (caveat)** for visible-but-cosmetic issues (audio
     pitch slightly off, etc.).
   - **Known issue** for crashes / corruption / freezes — file a
     GitHub issue first and link it.
5. Submit a PR.

This manifest is the cheapest credibility lever in the project: a
title list with verified statuses is more useful than any number
of internal benchmarks for telling a prospective user "yes, this
works for what you want to do".

## Automated compatibility corpus

`TestCompatibilityCorpus` (in `cmd/zx_go`) turns this manifest into an
automated regression guard: it loads a real title headless, drives it to
its title/menu screen, and asserts the rendered screen matches a recorded
golden hash over a settle window. This catches "a real game silently
stopped loading" — the class of bug a mechanism-level unit test passes
straight through (e.g. the Renegade-128K tape failure).

Game files are copyrighted and **not** committed. Point the corpus at a
folder holding them (titles whose files are absent skip, so CI stays
green):

```bash
# Run the corpus against your own game folder
ZX_GO_CORPUS=/path/to/games go test ./cmd/zx_go/ -run TestCompatibilityCorpus -v

# Record/refresh a title's golden screen hash (new title, or intended
# rendering change)
ZX_GO_CORPUS_UPDATE=1 ZX_GO_CORPUS=/path/to/games \
  go test ./cmd/zx_go/ -run TestCompatibilityCorpus -v
```

To add a title, append a `corpusTitle` to the table in `corpus_test.go`
(file, model, load type, key schedule, frame count) and record its golden.

## Loader fuzzing

The file parsers are fuzzed (Go native fuzzing) so corrupt or hostile
input is rejected, never crashes:

```bash
go test ./pkg/snapshot/ -run x -fuzz FuzzLoadBytes -fuzztime 60s   # .sna/.z80/.szx
go test ./pkg/betadisk/ -run x -fuzz FuzzLoadImage -fuzztime 60s   # .trd
go test ./pkg/ula/      -run x -fuzz FuzzLoadTAP  -fuzztime 60s    # .tap (+ FuzzLoadTZX)
```

The seed corpora run as part of the normal `go test ./...`.
